# Project Description

This repository contains the materials for an undergraduate project focused on analyzing battery data using digital signal processing and deep learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

### Model and Utilities
- `pretrained_model`: Stores the model saved after training.
- `util_function`: Includes utility functions for data processing and model training.
- `Model_pretraining.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that pre-trains all the models and evaluates their performance.
- `model_architecture.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that visualizes the architecture of each model.

### Data Pre-processing
- `LowPassFilter_datapreprocessing`: Contains MATLAB scripts for data pre-processing using low-pass filters.

### Graphs
- `graph`: Consolidates all graphs referenced in the project report.
- `graph_model_architecture`: Contains graphs of the model architecture, also merged into the `graph` folder.
- `graph_postprocessing`: Comprises graphs from the post-processing stage, integrated into the `graph` folder.
